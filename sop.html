    <td class="tg-0pky">Statement of interest: In order to help us evaluate how you might fit into our department, please provide a brief description of your research interests.  If you have direct experience with astronomical research, then tell us about the specific problem(s) that you have worked on, what your responsibilities were, what you learned from the process, and how this engagement inspired you to want to apply to graduate school. Also, let us know if you have experience writing papers, delivering presentations or posters, or attending meetings.  Alternatively, if you have not been directly involved in research, please tell us which classes, instructors, or other experiences have inspired you to apply to our program.  As you write, keep in mind that we are looking to understand how your interests and experiences might be a good match for NMSUâ€™s research groups.  A CV is not required, but is generally helpful, so feel free to upload one as a separate document.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">What would you consider your special qualifications to be, over and above those called for on the previous pages of the application? Discuss briefly your experience relative to the area of proposed study outside the classroom. What do you propose to do with your advanced degree, professionally? A statement of purpose, decribing interests and motivation to pursue a PhD degree.Note that your statement will be read by physicists outside your own field, and the level should be such that anyone with a Bachelor degree in physics can understand it. One thing we try to distill from your statement is how excited you are about physics and your research. So do not put in too many details because this easily may make it boring to someone who is not in the field. Also do no make it longer than one page. Remind that we have to read hundreds of statements, and we really appreciate if a statement is interesting and exciting. </td>
